## Running the example
This project has been set up to run the exact same codebase in two modes:
simple development mode (inefficient) and optimized production mode. By 
looking at the console output as well as your browser's Development Tools
it is easy to see the relative improvement in application size.

### Development mode
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. In your browser navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
4. `ctrl-c` to quit

### Production mode
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start:aot`
3. In your browser navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
4. `ctrl-c` to quit
